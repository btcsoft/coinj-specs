# coinj-specs

This is a Coinj stack related project encapsulating common traits of various crypto-coins. Latter may be divided by classes of hash algorithms used: scrypt-based coins (LTC, Doge), x11-based coins (DASH, digital), etc. For now, it's just a couple of maven artifacts for common use in Coinj coins implementations.
